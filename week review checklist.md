## review bigger goals
- look at [[life planning - perfect 2025 - what would make that?]]
	- add reflections of week to be reviewed on bottom
- decide what things from that list I'm going to bite off at that point

## plan the week, then reflect
- [x] open calendar get sense of avail time for the week
- [x] open: prev week note, current week note (to be planned)
- [x] see what didn't get done last week, decide "do this week or backlog?"
- [x] decide tasks to put on the docket for next week. [[gtd - projects]]
- [ ] go back and review previous week

## add wisdom here
- [[weekly review - wisdom of]]

- (( I like this reflection section, nice to have a spot to write out ideas and process what happens next week. ))
- in case I need it, here's how I got to the week template thing: [[weekly cron job]].
	- to be clear, the thing of "mat look at the week's note and get tasks to work on."
