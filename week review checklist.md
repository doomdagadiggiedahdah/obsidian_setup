## 1. review bigger goals
- visit [[life planning - perfect 2025 - what would make that?]]
- just look at all the goals (gives a sense of your horizon line).
- next, reflect on past week's experiences (good and bad) with those longer term goals.
	- split tabs with both tabs on perfect {year}
	- have high level goals on LHS, reflections (to type) on RHS. 
		- (this way you can see what you're comparing against. I had context switching cognitive stuff when I could saccad back and forth. or maybe that's bullshit.)
	- go through each goal and add reflections of week to be reviewed on bottom

## 2. review the week
- [ ] go back and review previous week

## 3. then plan the week
- [ ] open calendar get sense of avail time for the week
- [ ] open: prev week note, current week note (to be planned)
- [ ] see what didn't get done last week, decide "do this week or backlog?"
- [ ] decide tasks to put on the docket for next week. 
	- [ ] look at perfect 2025 goals and figure out what tasks to take from there
	- [ ] then look at [[gtd - projects]] and [[mission - moc#to do's]] to find next thing.

## add wisdom here
- [[weekly review - wisdom of]]

- (( I like this reflection section, nice to have a spot to write out ideas and process what happens next week. ))
- in case I need it, here's how I got to the week template thing: [[weekly cron job]].
	- to be clear, the thing of "mat look at the week's note and get tasks to work on."
