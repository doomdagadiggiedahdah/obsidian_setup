## review bigger goals
- look at [[life planning - perfect 2025 - what would make that?]]
	- add reflections of week to be reviewed on bottom
- decide what things from that list I'm going to bite off at that point

## plan the week, then reflect
- [ ] open calendar get sense of avail time for the week
- [ ] open: prev week note, current week note (to be planned)
	- Use prev week reflection area to determine next week's tasks ([[w-2025-W05#short reflection|for example]])
- [ ] see what didn't get done last week, decide "do this week or backlog?"
- [ ] decide tasks to put on the docket for next week.
- [ ] projects:: [[gtd - projects]]
	- [ ] take things from projects and put them on weekly note. execute
- [ ] go back and review previous week

## add wisdom here
- [[weekly review - wisdom of]]

- (( I like this reflection section, nice to have a spot to write out ideas and process what happens next week. ))
- in case I need it, here's how I got to the week template thing: [[weekly cron job]].
	- to be clear, the thing of "mat look at the week's note and get tasks to work on."
